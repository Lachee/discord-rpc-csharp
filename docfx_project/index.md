This is a C# _implementation_ of the [Discord RPC](https://github.com/discordapp/discord-rpc) library which was originally written in C++. This avoids having to use the official C++ and instead provides a managed way of using the Rich Presence within the .NET environment*.

This library supports all features of the Rich Presence that the official C++ library supports, plus a few extra:

- **Message Queuing**
- **Threaded Reads**
- **Managed Pipes**
- **Error Handling** & **Error Checking** with automatic reconnects
- **Events from Discord** (such as presence update and join requests)
- **Full Rich Presence Implementation** (including Join / Spectate)
- **Inline Documented** (for all your intelli-sense needs)
- **Helper Functionality** (eg: AvatarURL generator from Join Requests)
- **Ghost Prevention** (Tells discord to clear the RP on disposal)
- **Full Unity3D Editor** (Contains all the tools, inspectors and helpers for a Unity3D game all in one package).

## Quick Start

Check out the [Introduction](https://lachee.github.io/discord-rpc-csharp/docs/articles/intro.html) article on how to get your Rich Presence working. Here is a summary of what is given:

1. Download on [Nuget](https://nuget.org/packages/DiscordRichPresence/) or [Artifacts](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Lachee/discord-rpc-csharp/build/artifacts)
2. Include [Newtonsoft.JSON](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) Dependency
3. Setup the client:

```cs
client = new DiscordRpcClient("myappid");
client.Initialize();
```

4. Send Presence: `client.SetPresence(presence);`
5. Invoke Events Regularly: `client.Invoke();`
6. Dispose when done: `client.Dispose();`
