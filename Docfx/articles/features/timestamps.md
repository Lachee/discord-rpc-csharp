# Timestamps
You can display timers and progress in your activity. However, Discord likes to change their mind on how these are displayed. Below is a matrix of all the variety of timers you can set and what they will do.

| Activity Type / Timestamps | `null` | `Timestamps.Now` | `Timestamps.FromTimespan` |
|---------------|------------------|------------|--------------|

Your control over what is displayed is limited. You use to be able to set a count down timer in a Playing activity, but Discord has since removed that. Now the only purpose of setting a timestamp is for Listening and Watching activities.

As an example, the following snippet of code will make it as if you are playing a Video.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="https://i.lu.je/2025/Discord_GzHlOd9WUE.png" alt="Users activity saying 'Watching Skibidi Toilet'"></td>
        <td><img src="https://i.lu.je/2025/Discord_oiR7lMxial.png" alt="Users rich presence saying 'Watching Discord IPC.NET' and a timeline"></td>
    </tr>
</table>


```cs
client.SetPresence(new RichPresence()
{
    Type = ActivityType.Watching,
    StatusDisplay = StatusDisplayType.Details,
    Details = "Skibidi Toilet - Season 1",
    State = "DaFuq!?Boom!",
    Timestamps = Timestamps.FromTimeSpan(66),
});
```

> [!TIP]
> This library provides a variety of ways to set the time. 
> The [Timestamps.FromTimeSpan](xref:api/DiscordRPC.Timestamps) will allow you to use seconds, or a `System.DateTime.TimeSpan`.
