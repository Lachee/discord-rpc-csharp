# Buttons

Everyone's favourite, buttons! Buttons allow you to display clickable links inside your presence. They take an external URL and will redirect the user to it on visit.

> [!NOTE]
> You are able to display **2** buttons at once as part of your presence.

> [!WARNING]
> You are unable to view buttons or click on them for your own activity. Only other users can see and click on the buttons.
