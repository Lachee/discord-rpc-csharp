# Welcome to the Discord RPC C# Contribution Guide
Thank you for wanting to contribute to this project! All contributions are welcome, but please make note of some of the rules and guidelines I have set out in this file to get your changes accepted.

## ðŸ¥² Unwanted Contributions
All contributions are welcome and I am happy for any contribution. However, there are some things that will not be accepted:
- Spelling only fixes (rude to only contribute to something copilot could do)
- Complete or large rewrites (unwanted work load to review)
- Dependency substitutions / removals / additions (these require a issue and discussion first)
- Support for features only provided by custom Discord clients
- Obviously AI additions

## ðŸ¤“ Some Points
- All namespaces must retain `DiscordRPC` as the root.
- Do not include licensing headers. The codebase is already licensed.
- All public methods, fields, and properties must be documented.
- If adding new Rich Presence fields:
    - Add an example of them being used in the `DiscordRPC.Example`
    - Add the check to the Rich Presence equality
    - Make sure not having it doesnt crash the app
- Any change must work for .NET Framework 4.5
    - This minimum is to support Unity3D 2020.X+, MonoGame, and Godot. These engines do not use the latest .NET library or use a custom implementation of the runtime.
    - Language features are capped to `C# 7.3` to support Unity
- Any changes must work for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. 
- If contributing Linux fixes, specify the setup in the PR and why its needed.
- Follow existing styling in the project.
    - 1 Tab Indentation ( yes, im disgusted too, but at the time this was the VS default )
    - Brackets on new lines
    - Bracketless IFS are allowed.
    - Use the gaurd paradigm
    - Getters with `=>` are allowed and so are string interpolation with `$"{value}"`
        - Planned to update the rest of the codebase with them.

## The Entities/ folder
I plan to move all objects into their own namespace called `DiscordRPC.Entity`, however this is a major breaking change and will likely be a `v2.0.0` release.
For now, to ease in maintainability, entities are within the `Entity/` folder but **do not have the correct namespace**. This is intentional.

> [!NOTE]
> Plans to also update the root namespace to either `Lachee.DiscordRPC`, `Lachee.DiscordIPC`, or simply `Lachee.Discord.RPC`. 
> A discussion is needed for the merit of a change like this.

## ðŸ«¡ Getting Started
1. Make sure .NET is installed
2. Install Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
3. Fork and clone the projec
4. Create a patch branch on your fork: `checkout -b patch-1` 
5. Make Changes
6. Test it works
7. Create a PR from your `patch-1` to `lachee/master` (or the default branch if that ever changes)

See the README for more about building and testing your version.
